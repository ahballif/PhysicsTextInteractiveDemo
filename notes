Having all the code (atleast the normal stuff) I think is something worth having. 
Being able to edit any if it is good if we can make a way to show the errors. I think that part is working. 

Plotly might be a good way to animate waves. 
If plotly doesn't work then maybe we just have to define the function in python and then
animate the function with javascript.
